    "\n",
    "The Mutual Information Index (MII) provides a way to quantify the association between race and district enrollment. It ranges from 0 to infinity, with larger values indicating a stronger association.\n",
    "\n",
    "- MII = 0: No association between race and district enrollment (i.e., the distribution of a racial group across districts is random).\n",
    "\n",
    "- MII > 0: Some association between race and district enrollment (i.e., the distribution of a racial group across districts is not random).\n",
    "\n",
    "To interpret the results, consider the following guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <b>Compare MII values across races</b>: By comparing the MII values of different racial groups, you can determine which groups show stronger associations with district enrollment. Higher MII values suggest that the distribution of a racial group is more concentrated in specific districts, indicating possible patterns or segregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <b>Evaluate MII values in the context of your data</b>: The absolute value of MII may not be meaningful by itself. Instead, consider the relative values of MII for different racial groups and interpret them in the context of your data, such as the geographical distribution of districts, historical factors, or socioeconomic factors that may influence the enrollment patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. <b>Use MII as a starting point for further analysis</b>: MII can help identify patterns and potential areas of concern, but it is not a definitive measure. Use the MII results as a starting point for further analysis, such as investigating the underlying causes of the observed associations or exploring the impact of policy changes on the distribution of racial groups across districts."
