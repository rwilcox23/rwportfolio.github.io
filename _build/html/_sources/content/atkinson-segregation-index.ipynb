    "## <u>Part 3</u>: <u>Interpreting the Atkinson Segregation Index Results</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "We have calculated the Atkinson segregation index for each school district in NYC, and our results show that the index varies widely across districts, ranging from 0.626 to 0.721.\n",
    "\n",
    "An Atkinson segregation index value of 0 indicates perfect integration, where each racial or ethnic group is represented in each school proportionally to their share of the overall student population. An Atkinson segregation index value of 1 indicates complete segregation, where each racial or ethnic group attends separate schools and there is no mixing between groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these benchmarks, we can interpret our results as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Districts with an Atkinson segregation index of less than 0.1 can be considered to have low levels of segregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Districts with an Atkinson segregation index between 0.1 and 0.6 can be considered to have moderate levels of segregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Districts with an Atkinson segregation index of greater than 0.6 can be considered to have high levels of segregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these guidelines, our results suggest that many NYC school districts have high levels of segregation. In particular, 12 out of 35 districts have Atkinson segregation indices of 0.7 or higher, indicating significant levels of segregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings have important implications for educational outcomes and opportunities in NYC, as segregation has been shown to be associated with a range of negative outcomes, such as lower academic achievement, reduced access to resources and opportunities, and increased social isolation. By using these results to inform policy decisions and interventions aimed at promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in education, we can work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive educational system for all students."
